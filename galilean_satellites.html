						<b>Detection of New Auroral Emissions at Io and Implications for Its Interaction with the Plasma Torus</b><br>

						<i>The Planetary Science Journal</i> Vol. 6, No. 8
						</p>
						<p>
						For this paper we analyzed Keck I/HIRES spectra of Io in eclipse taken over six nights between 2022 and 2024.
						A combination of my HIRES data reduction and aurora processing pipelines allowed us to detect several optical wavelength emissions from Io for the first time:
						the O&#8239;<z class="small-caps">i</z> lines at 777.4 and 844.6 nm, the Na&#8239;<z class="small-caps">i</z> lines at 818.3 and 819.5 nm,
						the [S&#8239;<z class="small-caps">i</z>] lines at 458.9 and 772.5 nm, the S&#8239;<z class="small-caps">i</z> triplet at 922.3 nm,
						the [O&#8239;<z class="small-caps">ii</z>] lines at 732.0 and 733.0 nm, and the [S&#8239;<z class="small-caps">ii</z>] lines at 406.9, 407.6, 671.6, and 673.1 nm.
						We then compared our detections to narrowband images of Io in eclipse taken during the Cassini flyby in 2001 to see if we could determine where different emissions
						originated from Io. For instance, were they localized to just the sub-Jovian spot or did they include diffuse limb emissions? Or were they potentially isolated to the locations of volcanic features?
						Finally, we used our auroral emission model to try to determine which atmospheric constitutents were responsible for the auroral emission. This involves the use of excitation or emission cross sections
						for electron impact on the constituents in question. Unfortunately, many of these do not exist for sulfur-bearing molecules like SO and SO<sub>2</sub>,
							limiting the lines we could analyze and requiring us to use O<sub>2</sub> as a proxy for SO.

						<b>Short-timescale Spatial Variability of Ganymede's Optical Aurora</b><br>
						Zachariah Milby, Katherine de Kleer, Carl Schmidt, François Leblanc<br>
						<i>The Planetary Science Journal</i> Vol. 5, No. 7
						</p>
						<p>
						Ganymede's auroras are the product of complex interactions between its intrinsic magnetosphere and the
							surrounding Jovian plasma environment and can be used to derive both atmospheric composition and
							density. In this study, we analyzed a time series of Ganymede's optical auroras taken with
							Keck I/HIRES during eclipse by Jupiter on 2021 June 8 UTC, one day after the Juno flyby of Ganymede.
							The data had sufficient signal-to-noise in individual 5 minute observations to allow for the first
							high-cadence analysis of the spatial distribution of the optical aurora brightness and the ratio
							between the [O&#8239;<z class="small-caps">i</z>] 630.0 and 557.7 nm disk-integrated auroral
							brightnesses—a quantity diagnostic of
							the relative abundances of O, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in Ganymede's atmosphere. We found that the hemisphere
							closer to the centrifugal equator of Jupiter's magnetosphere (where electron number density is
							highest) was up to twice as bright as the opposing hemisphere. The dusk (trailing) hemisphere,
							subjected to the highest flux of charged particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, was also consistently
							almost twice as bright as the dawn (leading) hemisphere. We modeled emission from simulated O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O
							atmospheres during eclipse and found that if Ganymede hosts an H<sub>2</sub>O sublimation atmosphere in sunlight,
							it must collapse on a faster timescale than expected to explain its absence in our data given our
							current understanding of Ganymede's surface properties.

						<b>The Optical Aurorae of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto</b><br>
						Katherine de Kleer, Zachariah Milby, Carl Schmidt, Maria Camarca, Michael E. Brown<br>
						<i>The Planetary Science Journal</i> Vol. 4, No. 2
						</p>
						<p>
						The tenuous atmospheres of the Galilean satellites are sourced from their surfaces and produced by a
							combination of plasma-surface interactions and thermal processes. Even though they are thin, these
							atmospheres can be studied via their auroral emissions, and most work to date has focused on their
							aurorae at UV wavelengths. Here we present the first detections of the optical aurorae of Ganymede and
							Callisto, as well as detections of new optical auroral lines at Europa, based on observations of the
							targets over 10 Jupiter eclipses from 1998 to 2021 with Keck/HIRES. We present measurements of O&#8239;<z class="small-caps">i</z>
							emission at 6300/6364, 5577, 7774, and 8446 Å and place upper limits on hydrogen at 6563 Å. These
							constitute the first detections of emissions at 7774 and 8446 Å at a planetary body other than Earth.
							The simultaneous measurement of multiple emission lines provides robust constraints on atmospheric
							composition. We find that the eclipse atmospheres of Europa and Ganymede are composed predominantly of
							O<sub>2</sub>, with average column densities of (4.1 ± 0.1) × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup> and (4.7 ± 0.1) × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup>, respectively.
							We find weak evidence for H<sub>2</sub>O in Europa's bulk atmosphere at an H<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> ratio of ~0.25, and place only
							an upper limit on H<sub>2</sub>O in Ganymede's bulk atmosphere, corresponding to H<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> < 0.6. The column density
							of O<sub>2</sub> derived for Callisto is (4.0 ± 0.9) × 10<sup>15</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup> for an assumed electron density of 0.15 cm<sup>–3</sup>,
							but electron properties at Callisto's orbit are very poorly constrained.
