						Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN)'s Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph has identified 278 occurrences of discrete aurora events on Mars, which are patchy, sporadic ultraviolet
							emissions emanating from the upper atmosphere. We confirm prior results finding that emissions are highly correlated with crustal magnetic fields results, with the brightest and
							most frequent occurrences located around strong crustal fields in the southern hemisphere. The six-year data set shows that events can also occur globally, in regions of weak
							or absent crustal fields. We find that events occur primarily in evening hours, especially during favorable orientations of the interplanetary magnetic field. Under these conditions,
							auroral events probably occur nightly and last for hours. Optical counterparts to these UV emissions would probably be detectable with present-day instrumentation, and would be visible
							to future astronauts.

						We report results from a study of two consecutive Martian years of imaging observations of nitric oxide ultraviolet nightglow by the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) on the Mars Atmosphere and
							Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission spacecraft. The emission arises from recombination of N and O atoms in Mars' nightside mesosphere. The brightness traces the reaction rate as opposed to the
							abundance of constituents, revealing where circulation patterns concentrate N and O and enhance recombination. Emissions are brightest around the winter poles, with equatorial regions brightening
							around the equinoxes. These changes offer clear evidence of circulation patterns transitioning from a single cross-equatorial cell operating during solstice periods to more symmetric equator-to-poles
							circulation around the equinoxes. Prominent atmospheric tides intensify the emissions at different longitudes, latitude ranges, and seasons. We find a strong eastward-propagating diurnal tide (DE2)
							near the equator during the equinoxes, with a remarkably bright spot narrowly confined near (0°, 0°). Wave features at the opposite winter poles are dissimilar, reflecting different circulation
							patterns at perihelion versus aphelion. LMD-MGCM simulations agree with the patterns of most observed phenomena, confirming that the model captures the dominant physical processes. At the south winter
							pole, however, the model fails to match a strong wave-1 spiral feature. Observed brightnesses exceed model predictions by a factor of 1.9 globally, probably due to an underestimation of the dayside
							production of N and O atoms. Further study of discrepancies between the model and observations offers opportunities to improve our understanding of chemical and transport processes controlling the emission.

						<b>Nitric oxide nightglow and Martian mesospheric circulation from MAVEN/IUVS observations and LMD-MGCM predictions</b><br>

						We report results from a study of nitric oxide nightglow over the northern hemisphere of Mars during winter, the southern hemisphere during fall equinox, and equatorial latitudes during summer in the
							northern hemisphere based on observations of the δ and γ bands between 190 and 270 nm by the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission (MAVEN) spacecraft.
							The emission reveals recombination of N and O atoms dissociated on the dayside of Mars and transported to the nightside. We characterize the brightness (from 0.2 to 30 kR) and altitude (from 40 to 115 km)
							of the NO nightglow layer, as well as its topside scale height (mean of 11 km). We show the possible impact of atmospheric waves forcing longitudinal variability, associated with an increased brightness
							by a factor of 3 in the 140–200° longitude region in the northern hemisphere winter and in the –102° to –48° longitude region at summer. Such impact to the NO nightglow at Mars was not seen before. Quantitative
							comparison with calculations of the LMD-MGCM (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique-Mars Global Climate Model) suggests that the model globally reproduces the trends of the NO nightglow emission and its
							seasonal variation and also indicates large discrepancies (up to a factor 50 fainter in the model) in northern winter at low to middle latitudes. This suggests that the predicted transport is too efficient
							toward the night winter pole in the thermosphere by ∼20° latitude north.
